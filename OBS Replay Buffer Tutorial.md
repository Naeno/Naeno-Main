## Purpose of this Tutorial 
The replay buffer will allow you to save the last X seconds of Video and Audio to your disk at the press of a button. This is very similar to Nividia's Shadowplay feature where you don't have to actively be recording and creating large useless files. Finally get that sweet kill on a final boss? Just press that one button and have only the kill recorded to your disk.

# What do you need?
For the purpose of this tutorial, you will only need to download and use OBS Classic (OBS Studio will soon have the feature, making OBS Classic obsolete). The link to download OBS Classic can be found here: https://obsproject.com/

# How to set it up
1. Start up OBS Classic and create a new Scene along with a new Source within the scene that captures what you want.
